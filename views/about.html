    <h1>About Mandalorian</h1>

    <p>
      One of the primary themes of The Mandalorian is parenting and fatherhood,
      particularly through the father–son relationship dynamic between the
      Mandalorian and the Child.[63][64][65] Ryan Britt of Fatherly wrote that
      this is unusual in Star Wars stories, and that past examples of parenting
      in the franchise have tended to be poor ones, from the murderous Darth
      Vader (father of Luke Skywalker) to the neglectful Galen Erso, father of
      Jyn Erso in Rogue One (2016).[63] Britt wrote: "For years the Star Wars
      franchise avoided depicting a parent-child dynamic. With Mando and Baby
      Yoda, that's finally changing."[63] The dynamic between Kuiil and IG-11
      also reflect the childrearing theme in The Mandalorian. The two have a
      relationship similar to that of a father and son, as demonstrated in the
      scene in which Kuiil teaches IG-11 how to operate and function after the
      droid is reprogrammed.[66]

      The nature of good and evil and the question of nature versus nurture is
      raised repeatedly throughout The Mandalorian, perhaps most overtly through
      by Kuiil's reprogramming of IG-11 from a bounty hunter to a nurse droid
      and protector.[81][82] Even after IG-11 is reprogrammed, the Mandalorian
      does not believe he has truly changed, because he believes droids have an
      essential nature and that IG-11's nature remains murderous and
      untrustworthy.[83] But in reprogramming IG-11, Kuiil nurtures him and
      helps him to change; Kuiil feels that in the process of learning how to
      function again, IG-11 gained a new personality.[84] Kuiil insists to the
      Mandalorian: "Droids are not good or bad — they are neutral reflections of
      those who program them."[82] Keith Phipps of Vulture wrote of IG-11 and
      the nature versus nurture theme: "He's not bad. He's just programmed that
      way, and with care and change he can do a lot of good in the world."[81]
