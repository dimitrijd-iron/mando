# The Brief Tiny Site of Mando

Mandalorians are fictional people associated with the planet Mandalore in the Star Wars franchise created by George Lucas. First conceptualized for The Empire Strikes Back as a group of white-armored "supercommandos", the idea developed into a single bounty hunter character named Boba Fett.
